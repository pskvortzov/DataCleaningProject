##Project Description
This is the Course Project for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" course. The goal of the project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

The repo contains the following files:

- README.md: this readme file
- CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and all the transformations performed on the raw data
- run_analysis.R: a script that cleans the raw data

In order to prepare the tidy data set you need to [download the raw data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) and place it in the "data" folder next to the "run_analysis.R" script. The script creates a file named "tidy_data.txt" that contains the tidy data.
